# Portfolio

Link to the deployed page:   https://sthapa411.github.io/Portfolio/

Goal:
To update to portfolio with links to my github projects, my linkedin, and to my git hub profile page which has also been updated with my profile picture, pinned projects, and my contact info. 

Challenges:
I tried to design it completely differently at the begining. However, I ran with multiple design issues that proved to be time consuming. So, I decided to go with my previous design and tried to simplify it utilizing buttons, and cards.
